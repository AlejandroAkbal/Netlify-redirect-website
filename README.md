# Netlify redirect service

Make a Netlify website that redirects any endpoint to any URL.

## Examples

Imagine that you are using this on your **redirect**.example.com subdomain.

Then you can redirect the following endpoints.

- redirect.example.com/github --> github.com/example
- redirect.example.com/twitter --> twitter.com/example
- redirect.example.com/instagram --> instagram.com/example
- redirect.example.com/paypal --> paypal.me/example

## Usage

Check the [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) file to modify the redirect rules.
